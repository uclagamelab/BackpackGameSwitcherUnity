#### #### TODO #### #### #### #### #### #### 
* finish system for standardized controls
* Put in a gamemaker game.
* Put in some other games from.... http://games.ucla.edu/gamesBackup/games/
* put in darkgame
* Look at some other multi-arcade machines (OpenEmu, NeoGeo, thos multi consoles?)
* Write a list of things to do in an audit..
* Ken Burns effect on images?
* Auto generate joyToKey app associations file
* Add support for if a game crashes... if the switcher crashes
* Investigate how to make it start automatically on restart
* Make some kind of installer
* Make a couple different 'skins'
* Make the menu retake focus if nothing is running
* Support for 2 players
* Test on Lenovo computer
* Get feedback
* When specifyin an external game folder, also use Joy2Key there.
* Hide cursor in switcher app... think about what to do for other games (auto reposition to upper right on staring a game?)

#### #### Bugs ##################
- Rotato chipz would occasionally get the switchers music
- Ocasionally, focus would not return to the switcher ("also throw in a send keys on the time out?")
- Music not playing sometimes in attract mode. (something is happening on time-out)

#### #### Specific Issues #### #### #### #### #### #### 
* Videos not appearing on think pad??? switched render modes, maybe fixed, need to check
* Burn and Turn didn't get focus one time... see if that happens, do things still work? (maybe kill all processes before starting a game too??)
* fix this appFile, executable, directory nonsense in GameData class
* Make sure JoyToKey is acutally working...
* Test/fix when files/folders are missing/named incorrectly
* Test/fix when json misformed
* Refactor into something smarter... (Unity Events?)
* Study the processing sketch, and figure out how it's different from this one.
* Videos
* Checking if a game has stalled???

#### #### Architecture Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####

GameCatalog {List of gameDatas, able to populate self}s
	GameData {
		paths, images, metadata
	}

BGKeyListening { 
	Listening for the quit game key-combo
}

FGInput 
{ 
	Foreground Input, for controlling the menu 
}

ProcessManagement
{
	Windows, processes, cmd stuff, maybe some JoyToKey stuff hardcoded in for now
}

Front End Menu
{
	has access to the game catalog,
}

#### #### Other Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####
Goals:
Should be super easy to re-skin,
Should be super easy to change menu controls
Should be easy to add new data, and files to games
Should also work for non-games (just videos)
Probably would also like an extended image gallery / longer description in some cases

### ### Audit? #### #### #### #### #### ####
- check JSON validity
- check Exes, check if shortcuts valid
- check for missing image/video
- check for spaces in folder names.
- check that valid joytoKeyFiles are specified in JSON
- check general folder structure
- check validity of joyToKeyFiles (all have exit button mapped)

bulk edit joyToKeyFiles? (too hard?)
