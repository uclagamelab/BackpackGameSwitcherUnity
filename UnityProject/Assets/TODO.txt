Specific Issues:
 *fix this appFile, executable, directory nonsense in GameData class
* Make sure JoyToKey is acutally working...
* Test/fix when files/folders are missing/named incorrectly
* Test/fix when json misformed
* Refactor into something smarter... (Unity Events?)
* Study the processing sketch, and figure out how it's different from this one.
* Videos
* Checking if a game has stalled???

what separation makes sense???

GameCatalog {List of gameDatas, able to populate self}s
GameData {paths, images, metadata}
BGKeyListening{Just that}
FGInput {Foreground Input, for controlling the menu}
ProcessManagement{Windows, processes, cmd stuff, maybe some JoyToKey stuff hardcoded in for now}
UI{}


Goals:
Should be super easy to re-skin,
Should be super easy to change menu controls
Should be easy to add new data, and files to games
Should also work for non-games (just videos)
Probably would also like an extended image gallery / longer description in some cases


Killing the app... starting the app...

Something default
Something custom

"app type" : 
"unity"
"processing"
"gamemaker"
"other"

"custom stop script" 

App killing strategies:
record all processes before a launch, and kill ALL processes aside from those.
