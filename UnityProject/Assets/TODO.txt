DESIGN NOTES:
* more space below the selected bottom tab 
* More space above the selected tab
* "dim" the unselected tabs
* extend the bottom gradient, or build shadows into those tabs



BUGS:
* Fix current selection to not be based on video, but list position, make sure list stops when detail screen opened
* Smaller numbers of games

ADMIN ISSUES:
* Needing to restart when you change folders, other settings?
* Bugs with applying changes.

GAME ISSUES:
* Games that won't run full screen, don't have 1080p resolution (which ones?)
* Games that need their registrys set 
	(can record initial setup, but hard to get right on the first try)
	(Make Unity specific solution?  Programatically set the registry?)
	(Possible to suppress gamepad output? in joytokey, the other one?)
* Mouse issues:
	Add default mouse position to startup options

* Preserve JSON data not explicitly included in the class


FANCINESS:
* About section
* Sort by creator
* Image galleries
* Video player (for non-playable projects, etc...)


+++ Things found +++
https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro (joy to key alternative, open source, might be able to cannibalize)

#### #### TODO #### #### #### #### #### #### 
* need foreground lock applied to windows 7 too (don't check != 7 in tools/settings menu)
* Create warning dialog if no games
* Focus switching to switcher takes you out of attract mode
* Put in some other games from.... http://games.ucla.edu/gamesBackup/games/
* Figure out issue with itermittently tiny windows... (maybe fixed, but ok to have command line args for non-unity apps/shortcuts?)
* Fix scroll window of messages in tools menu
* Write a list of things to do in an audit..
* Ken Burns effect on images?
* Fix UI of folder selection
* Be able to create games from within Tools menu
* Auto generate joyToKey app associations file
* Add support for if a game crashes... if the switcher crashes
* Investigate how to make it start automatically on restart
* Make a couple different 'skins'
* Make the menu retake focus if nothing is running (!!!!)
* Support for 2 players
* Test on Lenovo computer
* Hide cursor in switcher app... think about what to do for other games (auto reposition to upper right on staring a game?)
* try with a browser game, a flashgame, others???

* Test/fix when files/folders are missing/named incorrectly
* Test/fix when json misformed
* Refactor into something smarter... (Unity Events?)
* Study the processing sketch, and figure out how it's different from this one.
* Checking if a game has stalled???

* Attract mode should play random bits of videos from other games too, have big game lab logo

#### #### What should exist for a game??? #### #### 
An image gallery? (just cycle through nearly full screen images, light box style?)
A preview video (just 1 for now?, just make part of image gallery?)
A game description (keep in JSON for now)
game controls (standardized? custom image? Either or?)
game credits (defer until later.)


#### #### Bugs ##################
- Rotato chipz would occasionally get the switchers music.  Switch to a more active form of focus checking?
- Ocasionally, focus would not return to the switcher ("also throw in a send keys on the time out?")
- Music not playing sometimes in attract mode. (something is happening on time-out)



#### #### Architecture Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####

GameCatalog {List of gameDatas, able to populate self}s
	GameData {
		paths, images, metadata
	}

BGKeyListening { 
	Listening for the quit game key-combo
}

FGInput 
{ 
	Foreground Input, for controlling the menu 
}

ProcessManagement
{
	Windows, processes, cmd stuff, maybe some JoyToKey stuff hardcoded in for now
}

Front End Menu
{
	has access to the game catalog,
}

#### #### Other Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####
Goals:
Should be super easy to re-skin,
Should be super easy to change menu controls
Should be easy to add new data, and files to games
Should also work for non-games (just videos)
Probably would also like an extended image gallery / longer description in some cases

### ### Audit? #### #### #### #### #### ####
- check JSON validity
- check Exes, check if shortcuts valid
- check for missing image/video
- check for spaces in folder names.
- check that valid joytoKeyFiles are specified in JSON
- check general folder structure
- check validity of joyToKeyFiles (all have exit button mapped)

bulk edit joyToKeyFiles? (too hard?)
