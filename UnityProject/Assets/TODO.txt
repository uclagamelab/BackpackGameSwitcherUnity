* When specifyin an external game folder, also use Joy2Key there.
* Hide cursor in switcher app... think about what to do for other games (auto reposition to upper right on staring a game?)
* try with a browser game, a flashgame, others???

* Test/fix when files/folders are missing/named incorrectly

* Attract mode should play random bits of videos from other games too, have big game lab logo

#### #### What should exist for a game??? #### #### 
An image gallery? (just cycle through nearly full screen images, light box style?)
A preview video (just 1 for now?, just make part of image gallery?)
A game description (keep in JSON for now)
game controls (standardized? custom image? Either or?)
game credits (defer until later.)


#### #### Bugs ##################
- Rotato chipz would occasionally get the switchers music.  Switch to a more active form of focus checking?
- Ocasionally, focus would not return to the switcher ("also throw in a send keys on the time out?")
- Music not playing sometimes in attract mode. (something is happening on time-out)



#### #### Architecture Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####

GameCatalog {List of gameDatas, able to populate self}s
	GameData {
		paths, images, metadata
	}

BGKeyListening { 
	Listening for the quit game key-combo
}

FGInput 
{ 
	Foreground Input, for controlling the menu 
}

ProcessManagement
{
	Windows, processes, cmd stuff, maybe some JoyToKey stuff hardcoded in for now
}

Front End Menu
{
	has access to the game catalog,
}

#### #### Other Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####
Goals:
Should be super easy to re-skin,
Should be super easy to change menu controls
Should be easy to add new data, and files to games
Should also work for non-games (just videos)
Probably would also like an extended image gallery / longer description in some cases

### ### Audit? #### #### #### #### #### ####
- check JSON validity
- check Exes, check if shortcuts valid
- check for missing image/video
- check for spaces in folder names.
- check that valid joytoKeyFiles are specified in JSON
- check general folder structure
- check validity of joyToKeyFiles (all have exit button mapped)

bulk edit joyToKeyFiles? (too hard?)
