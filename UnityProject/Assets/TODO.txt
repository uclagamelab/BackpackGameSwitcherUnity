#### #### TODO #### #### #### #### #### #### 
* Add support for Video previews (full screen background?)
* Add support for non-playable games just as videos
* Auto generate joyToKey app associations file
* Create a 'Wizard' / Admin / Audit
* Test with a lot more games
* Add support for if a game crashes... if the switcher crashes
* Investigate how to make it start automatically on restart
* Make some kind of installer
* Make a couple different 'skins'

#### #### Specific Issues #### #### #### #### #### ####

* Make sure JoyToKey is acutally working...
* Test/fix when files/folders are missing/named incorrectly

#### #### Architecture Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####

GameCatalog {List of gameDatas, able to populate self}s
	GameData {
		paths, images, metadata
	}

BGKeyListening { 
	Listening for the quit game key-combo
}

FGInput 
{ 
	Foreground Input, for controlling the menu 
}

ProcessManagement
{
	Windows, processes, cmd stuff, maybe some JoyToKey stuff hardcoded in for now
}

Front End Menu
{
	has access to the game catalog,
}

#### #### Other Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####
Goals:
Should be super easy to re-skin,
Should be super easy to change menu controls
Should be easy to add new data, and files to games
Should also work for non-games (just videos)
Probably would also like an extended image gallery / longer description in some cases
