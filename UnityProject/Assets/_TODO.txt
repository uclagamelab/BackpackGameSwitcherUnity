TODO:
* Clean up the settings menu
* Ditch the command line arguments, and make changeable via settings menu (?)
* finish making work with restart on crash

DESIGN NOTES:
* more space below the selected bottom tab 
* More space above the selected tab
* "dim" the unselected tabs
* extend the bottom gradient, or build shadows into those tabs



BUGS:

ADMIN ISSUES:
* Add commandline arg for no focus stealing
* Add commandline arg to not fix resolution/fullscreen
* Add commandline argument to now show rainmeter

* Needing to restart when you change folders, other settings?
* Bugs with applying changes.

GAME ISSUES:
* Games that won't run full screen, don't have 1080p resolution (which ones?)
* Games that need their registrys set 
	(can record initial setup, but hard to get right on the first try)
	(Make Unity specific solution?  Programatically set the registry?)
	(Possible to suppress gamepad output? in joytokey, the other one?)
* Mouse issues:
	Add default mouse position to startup options

* Preserve JSON data not explicitly included in the class


FANCINESS:
* About section
* Sort by creator
* Image galleries
* Video player (for non-playable projects, etc...)
* Ken Burns effect on images?
* Make a couple different 'skins'
* Support for 2 players

* Create warning dialog if no games
* Be able to create games from within Tools menu
* Auto generate joyToKey app associations file

#### #### What should exist for a game??? #### #### 
An image gallery? (just cycle through nearly full screen images, light box style?)
A preview video (just 1 for now?, just make part of image gallery?)
A game description (keep in JSON for now)
game controls (standardized? custom image? Either or?)
game credits (defer until later.)





#### #### Architecture Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####

GameCatalog {List of gameDatas, able to populate self}s
	GameData {
		paths, images, metadata
	}

BGKeyListening { 
	Listening for the quit game key-combo
}

FGInput 
{ 
	Foreground Input, for controlling the menu 
}

ProcessManagement
{
	Windows, processes, cmd stuff, maybe some JoyToKey stuff hardcoded in for now
}

Front End Menu
{
	has access to the game catalog,
}

#### #### Other Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####
Goals:
Should be super easy to re-skin,
Should be super easy to change menu controls
Should be easy to add new data, and files to games
Should also work for non-games (just videos)
Probably would also like an extended image gallery / longer description in some cases

### ### Audit? #### #### #### #### #### ####
- check JSON validity
- check Exes, check if shortcuts valid
- check for missing image/video
- check for spaces in folder names.
- check that valid joytoKeyFiles are specified in JSON
- check general folder structure
- check validity of joyToKeyFiles (all have exit button mapped)
