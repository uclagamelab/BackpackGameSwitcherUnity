TODO:
pressing:
* Application will crash if Cruise Control has no window title set, and a focus change happens
	Also, it seems to move focus back to switcher momentarily while cruise control is opening (probably fix with more forgiving determination of whether game is running)
* Add 'hidden' property to game, 'show hidden' to overall settings
* Improve determination of whether a game is running or not, less dependent on process null/hasExited 
 - once launched say running, and only say has exited if window appears then disappears, or quit keycombo, but not before.
 - relevant line to fix is "if (_lastActionWasQuit)" in SwitcherApplicationController

less important:
* Replace builtin mouse recorder with autoit version (would allow for long clicks, maybe other stuff)
* Custom cursors, hiding the cursor for other apps: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/use-powershell-to-change-the-mouse-pointer-scheme/
https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/106233-hide-the-mouse-cursor/
* Clean up the settings menu
* Ditch the command line arguments, and make changeable via settings menu (?)
* finish making work with restart on crash
* package joytokey profiles in game directories, and copy to joytokey directory
* take another pass at the documentation
* upload companion software somewhere? just add to git?
* try to make a new skin, refactoring as necessary


Refactor thoughts

**Simplified API for modifying skin
	Get List<GameData> of all available games
	Launch a game via its GameData
	Check if there is game running now, what game is currently running
	Event if game quits of its own accord
	Quit the current running game

**Also to separate
	Starting of JoyToKey
	Fullscreen img/video displayer
	background input module
	music module (probably this part wouldn't change for most visuals)

Assuming ctrl-k settings menu remains the same
	Separate options not pertinent to other skins(?)

BUGS
* If no valid folder, need to completely restart after setting a good one
* Needing to restart when you change folders, other settings?
* Bugs with applying changes.  

GAME ISSUES:
* Games that won't run full screen, don't have 1080p resolution (which ones?)
	-Unity games older than 3 and before don't respect fullscreen or width/height args

* Games that need their registrys set 
	(can record initial setup, but hard to get right on the first try)
	(Make Unity specific solution?  Programatically set the registry?)
	(Possible to suppress gamepad output? in joytokey, the other one?)
* Mouse issues:
	Add default mouse position to startup options

* Preserve JSON data not explicitly included in the class


FANCINESS:
* Playlists
* About section
* Sort by creator
* Image galleries
* Video player (for non-playable projects, etc...)
* Ken Burns effect on images?
* add "platform info" file, giving info about available controls, number of players, whether analog stick
* Doublecheck audit, see what it's able to show you
* Checking if a game has stalled???

#### #### Architecture Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####

GameCatalog {List of gameDatas, able to populate self}s
	GameData {
		paths, images, metadata
	}

BGKeyListening { 
	Listening for the quit game key-combo
}

FGInput 
{ 
	Foreground Input, for controlling the menu 
}

ProcessManagement
{
	Windows, processes, cmd stuff, maybe some JoyToKey stuff hardcoded in for now
}

Front End Menu
{
	has access to the game catalog,
}

#### #### Other Notes #### #### #### #### #### ####

### ### Audit? #### #### #### #### #### ####
- check JSON validity
- check Exes, check if shortcuts valid
- check for missing image/video
- check that valid joytoKeyFiles are specified in JSON
- check general folder structure
- check validity of joyToKeyFiles (all have exit button mapped)
